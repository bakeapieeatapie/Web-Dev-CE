        <h2>What it says</h2>
        <p>“We hold these truths to be <strong>self-evident,</strong> that all men are <em>created equal,</em> that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of happiness.”</p>

        <h2>why we are upset</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.</li>
           
            <li>He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.</li>
        </ol>
